If you're contacting me I encourage you take a copy of my public key and add it to your key ring. I always appreciate the effort it takes to encrypt communications and this is prefered. You can find my site related PGP public [key here]({{ site.url }}~ali/upload/aliraheem_smartcard_publickey.txt).

If you'd like to email me you can find it in the Public key (to prevent spam I wont publish it here), it's also on my github page should you be unable/ unwilling to check out my public key.


An alternative I am trying out is bitmessage, my blog bitmessage address is:
BM-NBUJc7oLbXkR2Az6VsYZ3baU9USTEtAb
![BitMessage addy: BM-NBUJc7oLbXkR2Az6VsYZ3baU9USTEtAb]({{ site.url }}~ali/upload/bitmessage_address.png)

Find out more about bitmessage [here](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page) and on a subreddit with some more featureful software [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitmessage). Bitmessage is experiemental and should not be relied upon for security or privacy, although that is the end goals. If you are worried about this go ahead and PGP encrypt the message.

Feel free to drop me a line, it gets lonely on bitmessage :D
