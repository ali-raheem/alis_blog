I am Ali Raheem, in my spare time I like to program and generally hack. You'll find some of my more interesting stuff and some personal work on github under the username [wolfmankurd](https://github.com/wolfmankurd/).

If you're contacting me I encourage you take a copy of my public key and add it to your key ring. I always appreciate the effort it takes to encrypt communications and this is prefered. You can find my site related PGP public [key here]({{ site.url }}~ali/aliraheem_smartcard_publickey.txt).

If you'd like to email me you can find it in the Public key (to prevent spam I wont publish it here), it's also on my github page should you be unable/ unwilling to check out my public key.


An alternative I am trying out is bitmessage, my blog bitmessage address is:
BM-NBUJc7oLbXkR2Az6VsYZ3baU9USTEtAb
![BitMessage addy: BM-NBUJc7oLbXkR2Az6VsYZ3baU9USTEtAb]({{ site.url }}~ali/upload/bitmessage_address.png)

Find out more about bitcoin [here](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitmessage). Bitmessage is experiemental and should not be relied upon for security or privacy, although that is the end goals. If you are worried about this go ahead and PGP encrypt the message.

Feel free to drop me a line, it gets lonely on bitmessage :D

Running this site is fairly low cost, but I also run two tor relays and a bridge. Recently I've started running a privacy supporting hidden service. Bitcoin tips are appreciated to help with these services (more funding = more bandwidth / more uptime).

If you'd like to tip me please send bitcoins to this address: 13vAwTea4CzZFjthoee7RzLpH9MReZwBhk
