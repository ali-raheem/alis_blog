I am Ali Raheem, in my spare time I like to program and generally hack. You'll find some of my more interesting stuff and some personal work on github under the username [wolfmankurd](https://github.com/wolfmankurd/).

Running this site is fairly low cost, but I also run two tor relays and a bridge. Recently I've started running a privacy supporting hidden service. Bitcoin tips are appreciated to help with these services (more funding = more bandwidth x more uptime).

If you'd like to tip me please send bitcoins to this address: 13vAwTea4CzZFjthoee7RzLpH9MReZwBhk
