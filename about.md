I am Ali Raheem, in my spare time I like to program and generally hack.

You'll find some of my more interesting stuff and some personal work on github under the username wolfmankurd.

You can find my site related PGP public key [key here]({{ site.url }}~ali/aliraheem_smartcard_publickey.txt).

To prevent spam you'll have to get my email from my PGP key.

And my bit message address (for the blog) is:

BM-NBUJc7oLbXkR2Az6VsYZ3baU9USTEtAb
![BitMessage addy: BM-NBUJc7oLbXkR2Az6VsYZ3baU9USTEtAb]({{ site.url }}~ali/uploads/bitmessage_address.png)

Feel free to drop me a line, it gets lonely on bitmessage :D

Tip Jar - goes towards running tor bridge, relay and a hidden service.
