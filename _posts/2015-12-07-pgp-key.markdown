Having a bit of a security reshuffle now that I have some spare time, so I've got a site related PGP key and BM address.

Just uploaded the new website related PGP key you can [find it here]({{ site.url }}~ali/aliraheem_smartcard_publickey.txt).

I'd encourage corrispondance via BitMessage (not to endorse it but purely because I am curious.) Surely there is nothing to loose if the data is PGP encrypted.

My BitMessage address for this blog is:

BM-NBUJc7oLbXkR2Az6VsYZ3baU9USTEtAb
![BitMessage addy: BM-NBUJc7oLbXkR2Az6VsYZ3baU9USTEtAb]({{ site.url }}~ali/bitmessage_address.png)

Enjoy,
Ali
