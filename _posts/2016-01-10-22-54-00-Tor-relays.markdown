I've brought up two more tor relays (rather than bridges) they ran as exit nodes for about a week before that became untenable. Now they are running as open tor relays (unfortunately the IPs wouldn't work well as bridges as they are black listed.)

Find them here tor.theraheemfamily.co.uk and tor1.theraheemfamily.co.uk.

Enjoy,

Ali
