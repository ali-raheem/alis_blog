I spent some time yesterday boning up on my Python, specifically learning to migrate to python3 from 2.x, I also took the opportunity to lean about making GUI's with QT5 through PyQt5. This simple database suited to simple id records combines sqlite3 with python3 and Qt5.

I'm relitively done with the coding and happy with the feature set and don't really see it changing much so I've moved it on to v1.0.0 and am releasing it with a free-all-permissive license.

You can find it [on gitHub here](https://github.com/wolfmankurd/id_book).

As always, enjoy.
