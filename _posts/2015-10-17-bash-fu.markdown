I thought I'd upload the short code snippet I used to alter all the references to the old blog in my online repository.

```
$ find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's:~ali/:~ali/old_blog/:g'
```

This uses find to look for all the files recursively and passes them via xargs to sed where an inplace replacement replaces all references to ~ali/ the old path with the new one ~ali/old_blog/.

Anyone that's all for now.
