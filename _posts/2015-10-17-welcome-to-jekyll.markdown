Welcome to my new site! I've finally recovered from loosing my local data to my old blog (and given up on trying to recover it!).

This time alround I'm using plain old jekyll because octopress was a _real_ pain in the butt!

My latest works include trying my hand at rust (check out my github repo: jukebox-rust) and boning up on python mainly learning python3 as I've only ever used python2.x (also check out my repo! id_book).
